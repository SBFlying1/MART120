<p>The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy adventure novel written by Norton Juster, 
with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, first published in 1961. The story follows a bored
young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth that transports him to the
once prosperous, but now troubled, Kingdom of Wisdom. Along with a dog named Tock and the
Humbug, Milo goes on a quest to the Castle in the Air seeking the kingdom's two exiled
princesses, named Rhyme and Reason. As Milo learns valuable lessons, he finds a love of
learning in a story full of puns and wordplay, such as exploring the literal meanings of idioms. (Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Tollbooth">Wikipedia</a>) </p>
